  <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook. It is used
    for building native-style applications for iOS and Android using JavaScript.
    It allows developers to build mobile applications that render native User
    Interface (UI) components. React Native leverages the React library,
    enabling developers to use a single codebase for multiple platforms.<br />
  </p> <br>
  <h1>2. Key Features</h1><br>
  <h2>2.1 Cross-Platform Development</h2><br>
  <p>React Native is renowned for its cross-platform development capabilities. Developers can write code once and deploy it on both iOS and Android, saving time and resources. This is achieved by using platform-specific versions of components, allowing the app to behave natively on each platform.</p><br>
  <h2>2.2 Native Performance</h2><br>
  <p>React Native applications use the same native platform APIs as other native apps, ensuring high performance and a smooth user experience. The framework provides a core set of platform-agnostic native components like View, Text, and Image that map directly to the platformâ€™s native UI building blocks.</p><br>
  <h2>2.3 Active Community and Ecosystem</h2><br>
  <p>React Native has a large and active developer community, contributing to its continuous improvement and providing a wealth of resources, libraries, and tools. The framework is supported by contributions from companies like Microsoft, Expo, and Infinite Red. </p><br>
